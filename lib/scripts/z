# Don't worry about it!!!

# When I use this syntax: 'source <(curl https://url-here);'
# in my local comp's shell, I'm able to source files
# from the internet into my current shell just fine.
# But if I use that syntax I get an error when I run:
# 'curl -s https://suckaaa.com/s/z'
# given it tries to source a file with:
# ex: 'source <(curl -s https://suckaaa.com/s/lib);'.
# It doesn't like the '<(' area â€” basically the cool part
# that looks like Kirby.
# So that's why I introduced the garbage lib.
# If anybody has any ideas on any of this, lemme know!,
# Until any better strategies are found, running the lib-installer
# and sourcing the garbage lib is just basically each bash file module's header
curl -s 'https://suckaaa.com/s/lib-installer' | sh;

# For the gateway script, we'll always want to
# force-update the garbage lib
curl -s https://suckaaa.com/s/lib > ~/.garbage/lib;

source ~/.garbage/lib;
clear;

# Minimize the window for a few seconds, then restore it
# printf '\e[2t' && sleep 3 && printf '\e[1t';
